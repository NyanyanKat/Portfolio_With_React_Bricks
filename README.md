# About

A personal portfolio app using the power of React Bricks CMS, NextJS and SSR. React Bricks is used to create visually editable blocks as React components for Next.js, Gatsby, Remix to instantly create, customize, and edit app for deployment. It contains all the advantages of a headless CMS. With the power of SSR and NextJS, I reduced compilation time by over 50%! In this project, I styled my personal portfolio using hero units, images, call to actions, and features. Utilizing the computing power of Codesandbox, my portfolio was compiled instantly and ready for production in no time.
