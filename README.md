# About

A personal portfolio app using the power of TypeScript, React Bricks CMS, NextJS, SSR and DigitalOcean. React Bricks is used to create visually editable blocks as React components for Next.js, Gatsby, Remix to instantly create, customize, and edit app for deployment. It contains all the advantages of a headless CMS. I styled the app beautifully with Tailwind CSS. With the power of SSR and NextJS, I reduced compilation time by over 50%! Utilizing DigitalOcean, the app was deployed successfully in no time
